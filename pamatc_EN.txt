$PAMTC,EN
Summary
Enable or disable the periodic transmission of individual standard NMEA 0183
sentences, and specify their rate of transmission.
Syntax
One of the following forms:
$PAMTC,EN,<2>,<3>,<4>[,<5>]*hh<CR><LF>
$PAMTC,EN,S*hh<CR><LF>
$PAMTC,EN,L*hh<CR><LF>
$PAMTC,EN,LD*hh<CR><LF>
$PAMTC,EN,Q*hh<CR><LF>
Fields
<2> <3> The identifier ALL, or one of the following sentence ID’s:
DTM, GGA, GLL, GSA, GSV, HDG, HDT, MDA,
MWD, MWVR, MWVT, RMC, ROT, VTG, VWR, VWT,
XDRA, XDRB, ZDA
If field <2> is the ALL identifier, then
0 = disable transmission of all sentences
1 = enable transmission of all sentences.
Otherwise,
0 = disable transmission of the specified sentence
1 = enable transmission of the specified sentence
<4> [<5>] The amount of time between successive transmissions of the specified
sentence, in tenths of a second. For example, if field <4> contains the
value 5, this specifies an interval of 0.5 seconds between successive
transmissions of the specified sentence. Value is 0-250, 0 to 25 seconds
by tenths.
If field <2> is the ALL identifier, then field <4> specifies the
transmission interval for all sentences.
Optional field used to specify the amount of time between successive
65
transmissions of the specified sentence in a new high precision format.
This field is only used when field <4> is Null. The format is “m:ss.hh”.
Where ‘m’ is minutes (0-174), ‘s’ is seconds (0-10440), and ‘hh’ is
decimal seconds (0-99). The maximum number of hundredths of
seconds is 1044013. Once the number of seconds is >= 60, the decimal
seconds are ignored.
The query outputs 2 numbers, the interval in tenths of seconds and the
interval in the m:ss.hh format. Some truncation will occur in the
former, if the interval is not a multiple of tenths of seconds.
If the interval is less than 26 seconds and a multiple of tenths of
seconds, the last field of the query (m:ss.hh) is dropped.
For example,
if field <5> contains
this value
The interval is Output of Query,
tenths,m:ss.hh
5 5 seconds 50
5.50 5.5 seconds 55
59.50 59.5 seconds 595,000:59.50
1:30 1 minute, 30 seconds 900,001:30.00
6000 6000 seconds 60000,100:00.00
0:30.25 30.25 seconds 302,000:30.25
25 25 seconds 250
25.55 25.55 seconds 255,000:25.55
26 26 seconds 260,000:26.00
If field <2> is the ALL identifier, then field <5> specifies the transmission
interval for all sentences.
Notes
While hundredths of seconds can be specified, the WX Series of WeatherStation
Sensors is limited to .05 second granularity.
The factory default settings are as follows:
Sentence ID Enabled by default? Default Transmission Interval
DTM No 0:1.00
GGA Yes 0:1.00
GLL No 0:1.00
GSA No 0:1.00
GSV No 0:1.00
HDG Yes 0:1.00
HDT No 0:1.00
66
MDA Yes 0:1.00
MWD No 0:1.00
MWV (R) Yes 0:1.00
MWV (T) No 0:1.00
RMC Yes 0:1.00
ROT No 0:1.00
VTG No 0:1.00
VWR No 0:1.00
VWT No 0:1.00
XDR (A) Yes 0:1.00
XDR (B) Yes 0:1.00
XDR (C) No 0:1.00
XDR (D) Yes 0:1.00
XDR (E) No 0:1.00
XDR (H) No 0:1.00
XDR (T) No 0:1.00
XDR (W) No 0:1.00
ZDA No 0:1.00
Build the above table from the control file.
Note that the MWV sentence appears in two forms: relative (R) and theoretical (T).
These two forms are enabled separately.
Also note that the XDR sentence appears in multiple. These forms are also enabled
separately.
If field <3> is a null field, then that field will remain unchanged from its previous value.
If both field <4> and <5> are null fields, then the interval will remain unchanged from its
previous value.
The selections as to which sentences are enabled for transmission, and the rate at which
each sentence is transmitted, are stored in nonvolatile EEPROM memory within the WX
Series WeatherStation Sensor. On power up, these settings are copied from EEPROM
into a working copy in RAM memory. It is the working copy in RAM that determines
the behavior of the WX Series WeatherStation Sensor, with regard to the transmission of
sentences.
Any changes to these settings using the $PAMTC,EN,<2>,<3>,<4> command only affect
the working copy in RAM. When power is lost, the changes to the working copy in
RAM will be lost.
The $PAMTC,EN,S command causes the contents of the current working copy in RAM
to be saved to EEPROM. The saved settings will then be restored to RAM each time
power is applied to the unit.
The $PAMTC,EN,L command allows the settings to be reloaded from EEPROM to
RAM without cycling power to the unit. This can be used to discard any changes made

to the working copy in RAM, and restore the saved settings as though the unit had been
turned off and then back on again.
The $PAMTC,EN,LD command loads the factory default settings from ROM memory
into RAM memory.
Note that the $PAMTC,ERST command (see separate description) differs from the
$PAMTC,EN,LD command in that $PAMTC,ERST will initialize all of user EEPROM
memory to its factory default settings. This includes settings unrelated to the selection of
transmitted sentences
